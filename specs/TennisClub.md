### TennisClub

A local tennis club has asked you to build a piece of software to help them to manage memberships, and register members for classes and book courts.

#### Inspired By

<!-- [Glofox](https://www.glofox.com/club-solution/), [Pike13](https://www.pike13.com/pike13-scheduling-software-demo) -->

#### Caution

You might try to create a Ruby class named `Class` - this is a reserved word in Ruby, so you will have to name your class `TennisClass`, or similar.
